NetPractice or we forgot to tell you what is a network and now you have to 'fix' it 
-----
NetPractice is based of a few thing such as <br>
- (router)<br>
- (Client)<br>
- (switch)<br>
- (Route)<br>
 and also 'interface'<br>

each of these element are linked with<br>
	- ip:93.5.4.193 <br>
	- Mask:( /26) or  255.255.255.240 <br>

to talk between  router,switch,client
the ip and mask must be in the propre range 

Route will always countain the ip of 
interface 'R' 

switch will alway have the same mask between R and the other element in  the same network 
the ip ending will aways  be the same  or similar
